to donate generously for the causes they believe in but usually end up doing nothing due
to no trust in the system around them. There are a lot of charitable organizations that
require funds now and then, which are working for the betterment of society. There are
four types of users such as Admin, Organizations, Volunteers, and users. Users can donate
some amount to the this organisation, organisation can see donations for the proposal. This
system will make the entire process more transparent. This Application provides trust between
the organisation and donors. The donation details is added to blockchain for more
security. This helps resolve the trust issues, as people already know what they are paying
for, and the system will help to solve the problem. The Transparent Charity Application is
a cutting-edge solution that harnesses the power of technology to bring transparency, 
accountability, and trust to the world of charitable organizations. This innovative application
aims to revolutionize the way donations are made and managed by providing a secure and
immutable platform that ensures the fair and efficient allocation of funds.
